                            <p class="maintext">The Ancients are the original builders of the Stargate network. At the time of their introduction in SG-1's "Maternal Instinct" (season 3), they have long Ascended beyond corporeal form into a higher plane of existence. The
                                humans of Earth are the "second evolution" of the Ancients. The Ancients (originally known as the Alterans) colonized the Milky Way galaxy millions of years ago and built a great empire. They also colonized the Pegasus
                                galaxy and seeded human life there, before being driven out by the Wraith. The civilization of the Ancients in the Milky Way was decimated thousands of years ago by a plague, and those who did not learn to ascend died out.
                                With few exceptions, the ascended Ancients respect free will and refuse to interfere in the affairs of the material galaxy. However, their legacy is felt profoundly throughout the Stargate universe, from their technologies
                                (such as Stargates and Atlantis, to the Ancient Technology Activation gene, that they introduced into the human genome through interbreeding) as well as many of the antagonists in the series, having resulted from failures
                                or negligence on the part of the Ancients.</p>

                        <p class="maintext">A benevolent race that, according to the mythology of Stargate, gave rise to Norse mythology on Earth and inspired accounts of the Roswell Greys. The Asgard can no longer reproduce and therefore perpetuate themselves by transferring
                            their minds into new clone bodies as necessary. Extremely advanced technologically, the threat of their intervention shields many planets in the Milky Way from Goa'uld attack, including Earth. They also provide much assistance
                            to Earth in the way of technology, equipment, and expertise. Their main adversary in Stargate SG-1 are the mechanical Replicators, against which they enlist the aid of SG-1 on several occasions. The entire Asgard civilization
                            chooses to self-destruct in "Unending", due to the degenerative effects of repeated cloning. A small rogue colony of Asgard, known as the Vanir, still exist in the Pegasus galaxy. They were able to slow cloning's diminishing
                            returns by experimenting on humans.</p>

                            to combat the Wraith but were ultimately abandoned for being too dangerous. Extremely aggressive, the nanites thrived and built an advanced civilization. In season 4, Rodney McKay activates the Asurans' attack code, causing
                            them to attack the Wraith, but this eventually comes to threaten all the inhabitants of Pegasus as the Asurans decide the best strategy is to starve the Wraith by eliminating all human life in the galaxy.</p>

                            arch that leads to an intended Utopian colony. Furling skeletons were originally planned to be featured in the episode, but the production of such proved to be too expensive. Jack O'Neill concludes that the Furlings must be
                            cute and cuddly creatures, based solely on their name. In "Citizen Joe", another character equates the Furlings to Ewoks based on their name.</p>

                        <p class="maintext">The Goa'uld are the dominant race in the Milky Way and the primary adversaries from seasons 1 to 8 of Stargate SG-1. They are a parasitic species that resemble finned snakes, which can burrow themselves into a humanoid's neck and
                            wrap around the spinal column. The Goa'uld symbiote then takes control of its host's body and mind, while providing longevity and perfect health. Thousands of years ago, the Goa'uld ruled over Earth, masquerading as gods from
                            ancient mythologies. They transplanted humans throughout the galaxy to serve as slaves and hosts, and they created the Jaffa to serve as incubators for their larvae. The most powerful Goa'uld in the galaxy are collectively
                            known as the System Lords.</p>
                        <p class="maintext">The Goa'uld are the first and most prominent alien race encountered by the SGC, and also one of the few nonhumanoid species to appear in the early seasons of the series. The Goa'uld are branded as evil by their pretending to be
                            gods and forcing people to submit to their quasireligious pronouncements.</p>

                        <p class="maintext">The humans of Earth play a central role in the story and mythology of the Stargate fictional universe. According to the Stargate film and Stargate SG-1, the parasitic Goa'uld ruled Earth thousands of years ago, posing as gods of
                            ancient Earth mythologies, and transplanted Earth humans throughout the galaxy via the Stargate. Thus, the Goa'uld and their Jaffa servants know the humans of Earth as the "Tau'ri" (/ˈtɔːri/ or /ˈtaʊri/), which means "the first
                            ones" or "those of the first world" in their fictional language. Earth is also known as "Midgard" by offworld humans protected by the Asgard, who masquerade as Norse gods. Stargate SG-1 further extended the backstory of Earth
                            humans by introducing the Ancients, an advanced race of humans from another galaxy. The Ancients regard the humans of Earth as their "second evolution", and some of their number merged with primitive human populations 10,000
                            years ago after they returned to Earth from Atlantis.</p>
                        <p class="maintext">Five thousand years ago, the people of Earth rose up against their Goa'uld oppressors, and buried their Stargate. The modern history of Earth and the Stargate begins when it is unearthed in Egypt in 1928. The device is brought
                            to the United States in 1939 to keep it out of Nazi hands and eventually installed in a facility in Creek Mountain, Colorado (Cheyenne Mountain in Stargate SG-1). In the events of the Stargate film, Dr. Daniel Jackson deciphers
                            the workings of the Stargate and a team is sent through to the planet on the other side. In "Children of the Gods", taking place a year after the film, Stargate Command is established in response to an attack by the Goa'uld
                            Apophis, and given the mandate to explore other worlds and obtain technologies that can be used to defend Earth. In the Stargate SG-1 spin-off Stargate Atlantis, the people of Earth establish a presence in the Pegasus galaxy.
                            The ancients who occupied Atlantis in the Pegasus galaxy are often referred to as the "Atlanteans" (or simply "Lanteans"), after their occupation of Atlantis.</p>

                        <p class="maintext">The Jaffa (usually pronounced jah'FAH) are modified humans genetically engineered by the Goa'uld in antiquity to serve as soldiers and as incubators for their young. Their story is primarily told through Teal'c. The main difference
                            between a Jaffa and a normal human is an abdominal pouch accessible from the outside by a X-shaped slit. The pouch serves as an incubator for a larval Goa'uld. Implanted during a "coming of age" rite known as a prim'tah, the
                            pouch improves the Goa'uld's ability to successfully take a host upon maturation from 50% to nearly 100%. The Goa'uld have a device capable of quickly transforming humans into Jaffa. The larval symbiote grants the Jaffa enhanced
                            strength, health, healing, and longevity (more than 150 years). However, the presence of the symbiote also replaces the Jaffa's immune system, and if removed the Jaffa will die a slow and painful death that can only be avoided
                            by either acquiring a new symbiote or by lifelong regular injections of the drug tretonin which replaces the Goa'uld functions in the Jaffa body. The Jaffa equivalent of puberty is the Age of Prata, at which time a prim'tah
                            must be performed. Jaffa do not require sleep, but must engage in a form of meditation called kel'no'reem to synchronize with their symbiote. It is possible for a Jaffa to communicate with his/her symbiote through a dangerously
                            deep state of kel'no'reem.</p>

                            be hundreds of years old and have a great desire for wisdom and understanding. They are extreme pacifists and never employ violence for any reason, even to defend themselves. As they have the ability to render themselves and
                            other objects invisible and intangible, as well as the ability to resurrect the dead, they never need to fight. They also have the ability to activate a Stargate wormhole without the use of a DHD. Although they outwardly seem
                            to be primitive forest-dwellers, they possess advanced technology beyond that of the Goa'uld, including a floating city. The Nox also appear in "Enigma" and "Pretense".</p>

                        <p class="maintext">A major threat in the cosmos, the Ori are Ascended beings who use their advanced knowledge of the universe to force lesser beings to worship them. In essence, they used to be Ancients, however they split into separate groups due
                            to different views of life. The Ori are religious while the Ancients prefer science. The Ori sway lesser-developed planets into worshipping them by promising Ascension through an invented and empty religion called "Origin".
                            This religion states that they created humanity and as such are to be worshiped by their creations. It also promises its followers that, on death, they will Ascend. However, Origin was designed to channel energy from the human
                            worshipers to the Ori. As such, the Ori never help anyone else Ascend because then they would have to share the power that they sap from their worshipers. Their ultimate goal is to completely destroy the Ascended Ancients,
                            who they know as "the Others". All of their efforts, including their technology, are for the purpose of garnering worshippers.</p>
                        <p class="maintext">As Ascended beings, the Ori do not interfere directly in the mortal plane. They use instead humans called Priors, which they artificially evolve so that they are one step from Ascension, giving the Priors godlike powers. Because
                            the Ori have worshipers across the entire home galaxy of the Ancients, and use their knowledge to spread, they are nearly unstoppable. For example: Ori warships, built using conventional means while operated through the supernatural
                            abilities of the Priors, are generally considered to be the most powerful vessels in the Stargate universe.</p>
                        <p class="maintext">The Ori might be regarded as a shadow form of the Goa'uld, with the significant difference that the Ori promise transcension to their followers but never provide it. The moral balance between the Ancients and the Ori clearly echoes
                            that of the Goa'uld and the Tok'ra.</p>

                            hostile to all other lifeforms in the universe, but are opposed primarily by the Asgard. In the episode "Unnatural Selection", the Replicators had developed human-form Replicators, based on the technology they extracted from
                            their Android creator, that appear just like humans and are able to change their form. Standard Replicators are resistant to energy weapons, and can only be destroyed by projectile weapons. Human-form Replicators, on the other
                            hand, are resistant to projectile weapons as well due to the change in their nature from large blocks to smaller units the size of organic cells (cell blocks).</p>
                        <p class="maintext">In the episode "New Order (Part 2)", an Ancient weapon called the Replicator Disruptor was developed by Jack O'Neill while he still had the knowledge of the Ancients in his mind. It works by blocking the cohesion between the blocks
                            that make up the Replicators. The Replicators in the Milky Way galaxy were wiped out by the Dakara Superweapon in the two-part episode "Reckoning" at the climax of Season 8. It has been indicated that the Asgard used the same
                            technology to defeat the Replicators in their own home galaxy as well.</p>

                        <p class="maintext">A vampire-like telepathic race who feed on the "life-force" of humans. While intelligent humanoids, they are genetically close to insects. They evolved in the Pegasus galaxy after a human population seeded by the Ancients was fed
                            upon by an insect called the irratus bug, which has the ability to draw upon a human's life to heal itself. As they fed, the bugs incorporated human DNA into themselves, giving rise to the Wraith. The Wraith too feed on humans,
                            treating them akin to livestock and regarding the act of feeding as nothing more than natural predation. Their existence is restricted to waking en masse every few centuries to replenish their health by galaxy-wide abductions
                            of humans called "cullings." A small selection of Wraith were tasked with remaining active during this time to maintain watch on the galaxy to prevent human reprisals.</p>
                        <p class="maintext">The main antagonists in Stargate Atlantis, the Wraith, are the dominant species in the Pegasus Galaxy. They are biologically immortal hive-based humanoids who feed on the "life-force" of humans, causing them to "lose years" in
                            a way similar to aging. The Wraith drove the Ancients out of Pegasus 10,000 years ago; they now maintain the human worlds of the Pegasus Galaxy as sources of food. The arrival of the Atlantis Expedition in the Pegasus Galaxy
                            leads to the Wraith waking prematurely from their hibernation; the human population of the Pegasus Galaxy is not enough to sustain all of the waking Wraith. To sate their hunger, the Wraith try to get to Earth whose population
                            is much bigger than that of the whole Pegasus Galaxy. This can only be achieved either through the Stargate or by getting more advanced Hyper drive technology, both of which are present in Atlantis. After the expedition tricked
                            them into thinking the city was destroyed, the Wraith began a brutal civil war.</p>
