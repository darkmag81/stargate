                                        and left them due to his involvement in military intelligence. Carolyn Lam grew up to be a doctor and was assigned to Stargate Command as chief medical officer in seasons 9 and 10. Bridges said that "Landry truly
                                        loves his work [but] respects and appreciates his daughter. He wants a real relationship with her and hopes that will happen some day. At the start of [season 9], you're not sure what their relationship is." The
                                        late season 10 episode "Family Ties" brings some conclusion to the Landry-Lam enstrangement, showing a reunification between Landry, Carolyn and Kim Lam in a restaurant.</p>

                                        the ATA gene (the genetic factor necessary to activate Ancient technology), but that he was naturally proficient at using it. After some doubts, he finally joined the expedition to Atlantis, although Colonel Marshall

                                        in the episode "Faith". Since Caine and the others' return (and subsequent death) without any memory of the baby in "Visitation" (episode 2.09), it is unknown whether the baby really died on-board Destiny, or underwent
                                        some other fate.</p>
