                        <h1 class="big">General Information</h1>
                        <p class="maintext"><img id="mainpic" src="../../assets/images/gate.jpg"><span class="firstword">Stargate</span> is a science fiction media franchise based on the film written by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. The franchise is based on the idea of an alien Einsteinâ€“Rosen bridge device (the Stargate) that enables nearly instantaneous travel across the cosmos. The franchise began with the film Stargate, released on October 28, 1994, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Carolco, which grossed US$197 million worldwide. In 1997, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner created a television series titled Stargate SG-1 as a sequel to the film. This show was joined by Stargate Atlantis in 2004, Stargate Universe in 2009, and a prequel web series, Stargate Origins, in 2018. Also consistent with the same story are a variety of books, video games and comic books, as well as the direct-to-DVD movies Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum, which concluded the first television show after 10 seasons.</p>
                        <p class="maintext"><span class="firstword">In 2011</span>, Stargate Universe, the last Stargate program on television, ended its run. Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions. In 2016, comic publisher American Mythology acquired the rights to publish new Stargate Atlantis stories set within the established franchise canon. This was expanded in 2017 to include new Stargate Universe comics as well, resolving the cliffhanger that ended the show. The predominant story arc thus ran on television for 15 years, including 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming, and 8 comic book issues as of July 2017. However, a variety of other media either ignore this main continuity or resets it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series Stargate Infinity.</p>
                        <p class="maintext"><span class="firstword">In 2017</span>, the franchise was revived with the announcement of a new prequel web series, Stargate Origins. Episodes premiered on a central "fan hub" for the franchise called Stargate Command, with a first season of ten 10-minute episodes.</p>
                        <p class="clearfix"></p>
                        <h1 class="big">Premise</h1>
                        <p class="maintext"><img  id="mainpic" src="../../assets/images/sg1poster.jpg"><span class="firstword">Stargate</span> productions center on the premise of a "Stargate," a ring-shaped portal that enables rapid transportation to other stargates located cosmic distances away. The story begins when one such device is discovered on Earth. The 1994 film and subsequent television series depict how the device is kept under the control of the United States government, who use it to conduct interplanetary missions by dialing the thousands of stargates located in the galaxy, which are the legacy of an ancient civilization. The expeditions originally had the goal of acquiring new technology and detecting threats, but often face humanitarian issues and the dilemmas of interacting with different societies. Finally they resulted in a constant need to continue the program to defend Earth from invading aliens.</p>
                        <p class="maintext"><span class="firstword">Combined</span> with the notion that the Stargate is a secret, Stargate productions are notable for presenting no contradiction with reality, being set in the present day on an otherwise normal Earth, and being dominated by human interaction in the galaxy. In the story of the 1994 film, this is explained as being the result of deportations by aliens, with the suggestion that ancient mythologies are the result of aliens posing as gods in the distant past (as in the unproven ancient astronaut hypothesis).</p>
                        <p class="maintext"><span class="firstword">The</span> longest-running series, Stargate SG-1 sets the context having the galaxy as a failed state in which Goa'uld System Lords war against each other. They also use superior technology to pose as gods to the human populations who had been deported from Earth to everywhere in the galaxy and who are kept in ignorance and slavery. The US Stargate Command represents simultaneously a higher level of civilization and a lower level of technology during conflicts. Only a small portion of stargate dial numbers do not lead to planets dominated by the Goa'uld.</p>
