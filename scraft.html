                                        retractable thrusters that allow them to travel through a Stargate, as well as powerful Drone weapons for self-defense and a cloaking device to avoid detection. They are operated via neural interface, and so the
                                        Ancient Technology Activation gene is required to activate and pilot the ship. </p>
                                    <p class="maintext clearfix">The name "Puddle Jumper" is a combination of a visual pun on the ship's ability to travel through the event horizon of a Stargate (an action also referred to as "Threading the Needle"), which resembles a pool of water,
                                        and a reference to the slang term 'puddle-jumper' on earth, which means a small plane intended for short distance flights. It was coined by Major John Sheppard, an experienced pilot, who found a serendipitous double
                                        meaning when describing the craft. The nomenclature of the ship was immediately protested by Dr. Rodney McKay and Lt. Aiden Ford, who preferred "Gateship", although their suggestion was rejected. As such, the name,
                                        "Puddle Jumper" stuck and has continued to be used to this day.</p>

                                        on Earth, city-ships are among the largest vessels ever developed.</p>

                                        As they are typically powered by three Zero Point Modules, the shields are exceptionally powerful, withstanding days of constant enemy fire with just one ZPM; though probably as a result of this, the hull itself
                                        is quite fragile. As evidenced by Atlantis, City-ships are inherently buoyant, capable of floating on the surface of a large body of water without any apparent technological aid; they can also rest on the bottom
                                        of an ocean, though again the shield is needed to prevent flooding.</p>

                                    <p class="maintext clearfix">After beginning this process, the Ancients initially planned to wait until the ship reached a sufficient distance from Earth to board it. However, because of other endeavors, like ascension, they never followed through
                                        on the plan. Because of this, Destiny has continued on a pre-programmed path on its journey throughout the stars, alone, for a million years. With the arrival of a Tau'ri expedition in 2009, Destiny has a new crew.</p>

                                        over both Death Gliders and Wraith Darts mainly due to its missiles, which are more effective in dogfight scenarios than forward firing energy weapons. Though not a normal feature, F-302s can be equipped with nuclear

                                        defensive equipment was installed during the ship's production rather than added after the fact. Following the extinction of the Asgard race, the Daedalus (as well as all other BC-304s) was retrofitted with Asgard
                                        plasma beam weapons. Propulsion consists of standard thrusters as well as an Asgard hyperdrive, capable of traveling between Earth and Atlantis in 18 days without the use of a Zero Point Module. Originally, to ensure
                                        that their technologies were not abused, an Asgard engineering expert was provided to monitor the ship's systems for the first two years of its operation. Following the Daedalus being put into service, it began

                                    <p class="maintext">The Ha'tak is a class of spaceship designed by the Goa'uld. During the reign of the Goa'uld empire in the Milky Way galaxy, the Ha'tak served as the main class of capital ship employed by most Goa'uld System Lords.
                                        During the height of the Goa'uld empire, the Ha'tak was among the most powerful vessels in the Milky Way, with hundreds having been positioned around the galaxy as to cement and project the power of the Goa'uld
                                        empire. Following the fall of the Goa'uld empire in 2005, the Ha'tak's presence in the galaxy endured, being adopted as the main battleship of the Free Jaffa Nation.</p>
                                    <p class="maintext clearfix">Though the Ha'tak remained largely unparalleled in terms of overall power when compared to the ships of most races in the galaxy for centuries, the Ha'tak's prestige has dramatically declined following the fall of the
                                        Goa'uld. The ships of several other races, including the Asgard, Tau'ri, and Ori, currently possess technologies and capabilities that far exceed that of the modern Ha'tak.</p>

                                    <p class="maintext clearfix">A Tel'tak is a vaguely pyramid-shaped vessel with an elongated nose. The rear section of the vessel curves into a pair of wings. When landed, the tips of the wings, located near the midsection, retract to allow boarding,
                                        then extend once more when in-flight. The ship is divided into two major sections—the flight deck, onto which the main entrance opens, and a cargo section in the back. They are separated by a bulkhead, which is
                                        removable to allow for more space during flight. Beyond the cargo hold is an engine room where all the control systems of the ship are located, this includes the many control crystals. The Tel'tak's primary role
                                        is that of a transport vessel, either for cargo or passengers.</p>
